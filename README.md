# hello-world
It's a repository! This is my first forray into Github. I hope to learn and contribute to this space!

I first learned to code in an Information Systems class I took while studying accounting in college. I loved writing programs with VBA and creating websites in HTML, but I rationalized that I was so close to graduating that it didn't make sense to switch majors. Fast forward 3 years and I have realied that the best time to start learning to code would have been 3 years ago in college. But luckily, the second best time is now! I am currently learning Python and Javascript. Better late than never!
